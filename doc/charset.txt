                               CHARSET SETTING                  
                                                   *charset-semiautodetection*

This is documentation for a script that can set character set of a file read
into vim, based on information (charset hint) in the file.

Note that this may be overkill for you; vim can distinguish many encodings
when |fileencodings| option is used; however, there are cases when it fails,
because encodings use same bytes as characters - typical example is latin1 vs.
latin2 vs. cp1250.

As default, the plugin can determine encoding of html and xml files, and of
text (.txt) files with certain hint (see below) on the last line. It is 
relatively easy to extend it to other file types.

GENERAL FILES                                                 *charset-hint*
The canonical form of a hint is charset=<charset name> on some fixed
(last, first, etc) line. It may share that line with other text, particulary
with vim modelines; in case of those modelines, it should precede them (vim is
otherwise confused as it tries to set charset as its option):

/* charset=latin-2 vim: set sw=8 */

Currently, the only files that use this by default are txt files. You can
instruct vim to use this plugin for other file types by adding

        :call ReloadWhenCharsetSet("$")

into respective ftplugin file; the parameter of function is the line number
that should be searched for charset hint. The "$" here stands for "last line".
There may be also optional second parameter that is used as a regexp for
charset template; see source for details of this.

HTML AND OTHER SPECIAL FILES                            *charset-hint-html*
Some special files  may have the information about charset already present
in other way; e.g., for html files, there is the "meta charset" tag that
should be used. You can add 

        :call ReloadWhenHtmlCharsetSet(pattern, line, sflags)

to other ftplugins, too; it jumps to line "line" and determines location of
charset using search() with sflags used as flags. Better read source to
understand. It is likely to change in next version, as it is really ugly.
See source for examples of usage for html and xml files.

MISCELLANEOUS                                   *charset-plugin-misc*
The plugin contains no mappings and             *loaded_charset_plugin*
You can prevent plugin from loading by 
        :let loaded_charset_plugin=1
in your .vimrc

It is better (from standpoint of a purist) to have relevant definitions in
ftplugin files; if you did this, you may set    *charset_calls_in_ftplugin*
        :let charset_calls_in_ftplugin=1
to prevent setting autocommands inside the plugin
